                I am currently working as a self-employed locum pharmacist, while studying part-time at NCI to complete my 
                Higher Diploma in Science in Computing. After almost 10 years in Pharmacy I am interested in transitioning 
                to a career in the ICT sector, specifically the area of software development.<br>
                <br>
                I feel that I would enjoy the challenges that a role in this sector would bring as it would allow me 
                to utilise not only my creative side, but also the extensive problem-solving skills I have developed 
                through my years of working as a pharmacist. The constant advances that are occurring in computing and 
                technology mean that a career in this industry would never be boring. There will always be new 
                challenges and opportunities to learn. I would love the chance to be a part of this exciting and ever 
                expanding sector.
