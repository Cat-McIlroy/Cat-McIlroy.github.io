For this project I was required to choose a type of online retail business that sells products to its customers. 
The business, at minimum would store information about the products (stock) or services it sells, the suppliers, 
the customers, the sales transactions, and the employees who handle the transactions.

I chose an online beauty product retailer.
Project criteria are detailed below.
I have uploaded my finished written project, my SQL code, and my Python code.

Part 1: Conceptual Design

- Describe/introduce the chosen retail business and its objectives (200-400 words).
- Identify the relevant entities of the business with their respective attributes, entity types and primary keys. 
You should include all the core entities of the business.
- Convert the entities and make sure that the tables are in a 3rd normal form.
- Identify the relationships to support the required business rules and assumptions.
- Draw an ER diagram for the system depicting the entities, relationships, cardinalities, 
participations using your preferred ERD notation.

Part 2: Logical and physical design

- Create the corresponding database using DDL commands 
- Create all the necessary tables identified above using DDL
- Populate at least three of your tables with some data using DML (insert into statement)
- Populate your database with a large data set representing a one-year transaction (01/01/2023 - 30/12/2023) on each table.  
(Use online data generators such as Mockaroo or generate data to generate synthetic data.)

Part 3: Write SQL Statements to answer the following queries

- Show all the products along with the supplier detail who supplied the products.
- Create a stored procedure that takes the start and end dates of the sales and display all the sales transactions 
between the start and the end dates.
- Create a view that shows the total number of items a customer buys from the business in October 2022 along with 
the total price (use group by)
- Create a trigger that adjusts the stock level every time a product is sold.
- Create a report of the annual sales (2022) of the business showing the total number of products sold and the total
price sold every month (use A group by with roll-up)
- Display the growth in sales/services (as a percentage) for your business, from the 1st month of opening until now. 
- Delete all customers who never buy a product from the business.
- Use a reporting tool of your choice (e.g. Excel) to connect to your data and create a graphical representation of the result of question 6 in Part 3.
